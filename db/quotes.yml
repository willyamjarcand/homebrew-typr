  - quote: "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it. I do have a test today, that wasn't bullshit. It's on European socialism. I mean, really, what's the point? I'm not European. I don't plan on being European."

  - quote: "You have been my friend. That in itself is a tremendous thing. I wove my webs for you because I liked you. After all, what's a life, anyway? We're born, we live a little while, we die. A spider's life can't help being something of a mess, with all this trapping and eating flies."
    source: "Charlotte's Web"

    source: "Martin Luther King Jr."

    source: "Robert Frost - The Road Not Taken"
  - quote: "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
